hw5: WebGL Image Search

This homework is designed to expand on a previous piece of coursework that
calls an image search API. Rather than just having the images show up in a
boring old gallery, I'll have them show up in some 3D representation. This project
should work just by opening index.html in a WebGL-compatible browser.

You can type in a search term in the top bar, then use the left and right
arrow keys to rotate the gallery. Under the canvas, a button can load more
images from the same term (pressing search again returns the same or similar
results).

Unfortunately, I was unable to get lighting working. I've included a .zip
with the files that attempt to use it, but I'm unsure of how to resolve the
current errors.

I spent around 10 hours on this assignment.

p.s. this has been a very good reminder that I need to work on my javascript.
