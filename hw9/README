hw9: Particle Volume 2

James Nichols
CSCI4239/5239 Spring 2021

The particle system is back with more potential particles, point sprites,
smoother transitions, and compute shaders!

Key bindings
  m          Toggle shader
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  +/-        Increase/Decrease volume
  a/d        Increase/Decrease particle count (sort of)
  ESC        Exit

I just wanted to give the particle system another shot with some of
the new features available to me in compute shaders. As you can see,
it looks a lot better now, but there are still some issues to work out,
mainly that there always seems to be a lot of particles, even at low
counts. I suspect this is due to the "real" amount of particles being
1,000,000. That said, I figured it was a better demo of a compute shader
to have a huge number of them anyways.
