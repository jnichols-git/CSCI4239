hw8: Particle Effects

Demonstrating a very basic use of shaders to show particle reflections

Key bindings
  m          Toggle shader
  o          Change objects
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  +/-        Change plane angle
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

A lot of the conversation we had in class regarding particle interaction
revolved around heavy CPU usage to accomplish it by calculating the position
there instead of in the shader. I was curious what steps could be taken to implement
environmental interaction in a shader, and accomplished basic reflection off of
a rotating plane.
